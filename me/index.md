Drop Computer is the technology/software blog of Nick Ball, a Software Developer in south Silicon Valley.

Here I share "interesting" stuff I'm working on or learning about. I'm doing this mostly to give myself an outlet for "longer-form" writing, and hoping someone else finds it useful or interesting.

# About the author
You can find my about page at [nickball.com](http://nickball.com).

# About the site
This site is a static site generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Posts are authored in Markdown, usually in vim. 

The site design has been forked and modified from [@getmicah](http://getmicah.github.io).

For peak buzzwordiness, the generated static site is hosted in an NGINX docker container, which is running in a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster (more on that to come).
